<h1>The School of Computer Science Engineer</h1>
<hr />
<p>If you want to be an Engineer of Computer, then all you need is a Computing machine with an internet connectivity. Education must be free and should be open to everyone. So here I present you with information that I've gathered for learning computer science in the best possible way.</p>
<p>This website is going to look like an old school version, that kinda stuff. So please bear.</p>
<h2>So why is this website?</h2>
<p>I know there is not much information you are going to gain by going to an University. All that you are gonna learn in an University is a divergent exposure to stuff, let it be friends,people,girls,boys. And at the end of your semester you'd receive a certificate tagging you as an engineer, With you having no actual knowledge on the subjects.</p>
<p>Everyone, by everyone I mean people from different branches of engineering are flowing towards Computer Science with the only aim of bagging a 6 figure salary. Please don't be that person.</p>
<h2>Why Computer Science?</h2>
<p>There are 2 types of software engineer: those who understand computer science well enough to do challenging, innovative work, and those who just get by because they’re familiar with a few high level tools.</p>
<p>Both call themselves software engineers, and both tend to earn similar salaries in their early careers. But Type 1 engineers grow in to more fulfilling and well-remunerated work over time, whether that’s valuable commercial work or breakthrough open-source projects, technical leadership or high-quality individual contributions.</p>
<p>Type 1 engineers find ways to learn computer science in depth, whether through conventional means or by relentlessly learning throughout their careers. Type 2 engineers typically stay at the surface, learning specific tools and technologies rather than their underlying foundations, only picking up new skills when the winds of technical fashion change.</p>
<p>Currently, the number of people entering the industry is rapidly increasing, while the number of CS grads is essentially static. This oversupply of Type 2 engineers is starting to reduce their employment opportunities and keep them out of the industry’s more fulfilling work. Whether you’re striving to become a Type 1 engineer or simply looking for more job security, learning computer science is the only reliable path.</p>
