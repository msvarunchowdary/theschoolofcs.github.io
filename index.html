<h1>The School of Computer Science Engineer</h1>
<hr />
<p>If you want to be an Engineer of Computer, then all you need is a Computing machine with an internet connectivity. Education must be free and should be open to everyone. So here I present you with information that I've gathered for learning computer science in the best possible way.</p>
<p>This website is going to look like an old school version, that kinda stuff. So please bear.</p>
<h2>So why is this website?</h2>
<p>I know there is not much information you are going to gain by going to an University. All that you are gonna learn in an University is a divergent exposure to stuff, let it be friends,people,girls,boys. And at the end of your semester you'd receive a certificate tagging you as an engineer, With you having no actual knowledge on the subjects.</p>
